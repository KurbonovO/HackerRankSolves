/*581 Given an integer array, you need to find one continuous subarray that if
you only sort this subarray in ascending order, then the whole array will be
sorted in ascending order, too. You need to find the shortest such subarray and
output its length.
Input: [2, 6, 4, 8, 10, 9, 15]					Output: 5
You need to sort [6, 4, 8, 10, 9] in ascending order to make the whole array
sorted in ascending order													 */
