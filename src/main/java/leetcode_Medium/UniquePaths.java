/*62 A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid (marked 'Start'
in the diagram below). The robot can only move either down or right at any
point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid
(marked 'Finish' in the diagram below). How many possible unique paths are 
there?
Input: m = 3, n = 2			Output: 3
From the top-left corner, there are a total of 3 ways to reach the bottom-right
corner:
1. Right -> Right -> Down
2. Right -> Down -> Right
3. Down -> Right -> Right
Input: m = 7, n = 3			Output: 28										 */
