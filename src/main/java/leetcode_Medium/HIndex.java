/*274 Given an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative integer) of
a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index. According
to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h if h of
his/her N papers have at least h citations each, and the other N − h papers
have no more than h citations each."
Input: citations = [3,0,6,1,5]		Output: 3 
[3,0,6,1,5] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had 
received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively. Since the researcher has 3
papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more than
3 citations each, her h-index is 3											 */
